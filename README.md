# TimeSeriesVisualizer

This is a geographic visualization of time series data.  Currently uses publicly available Covid-19 data sourced from http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19/data

The app processes more data series in the background than it displays, given the nature of the data, some of it was redundant and didn't necessitate a chart.

It is built using React using Material UI and Nivo charts.

Repository can be downloaded and requires no configuration (no keys, no customized settings)

It has some responsiveness built in to handle display on desktop, mobile with portrait or landscape orientation.  Supports navigation via buttons, arrow keys or swipe.
